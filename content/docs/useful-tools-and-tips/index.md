This is a collection of random tools and tips that you might find useful when creating resource packs.



## Sharing textures in higher quality
Sometimes, you want to get feedback, or show off your texture; but when you send it to someone, it shows as the tiniest image because of Minecraft's 16x16 resolution. To get round this, you need to scale the image without blurring it. There are two ways of doing this.  
**With an online tool**: you can use [this](https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/) tool to scale up your textures to send. It's incredibly easy to use, and does the job just fine.  
**With GIMP**: if you use GIMP, you can scale textures directly in your image editing software. Right click, press `Image`, then `Scale Image`. Choose a good size (100px at the very least), and set `Interpolation` to `None`. Press Scale, and there you have it. You can export this scaled image from GIMP however you like.


## Colour blender
When texturing, you want to get a nice gradient between two colours sometimes. [This tool](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/) does just the trick.


## JSON checker
When creating a really complicated model, you want to make sure you've got all the JSON syntax right, and you might want to clean it up as well. [This website](https://jsonchecker.com/) works fine.  
Note if you are using software like VS Code, you can have syntax checking directly in your editing software, so something like this is unnecessary.


## Colour codes
If you want colours in your resource packs description (in pack.mcmeta), you can use [this site](https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php).

## Colour Theory
I often find it hard to get colours that work well together. Having a quick read of these two articles can really help:  
[How to start making pixel art #6 Basic Color Theory](https://medium.com/pixel-grimoire/how-to-start-making-pixel-art-6-a74f562a4056)  
[Basic color schemes - Introduction to Color Theory](https://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-theory-intro.htm)

## Palette creator
If you're editing a vanilla texture, and you quickly need to get all the colours from an image to work with, you can do this is in one of two ways.  
**With an online tool**: you can use [this tool](http://www.coolphptools.com/color_extract#demo). It gives the HTML colour codes for you to copy and paste straight into your image editing software.  
**With GIMP**: if you are using GIMP as your image editor, duplicate your image (Ctrl+D), then right click, press `Image`, then `Mode`, then `Indexed`. Press `Convert` on the pop-up window, then this will create a [GIMP palette](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-palettes.html) for you to use. 


## GUI information
It is often confusing to work out which files do what when editing GUI. Although a bit outdated, [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g83uC9-sVpaSPghGSsTYYngDS2tbseDkW6ZRgGmadp8) is often really helpful.
