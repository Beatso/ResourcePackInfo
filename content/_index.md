# Resource Pack Info
Hey! I'm Beatso. I make Minecraft resource packs, amongst other stuff. This is a small wiki for bits of info that can be useful when creating a Minecraft resource pack. It's mostly stuff that I didn't find was immediately obvious when searching the web.  
I hope you find this useful!
